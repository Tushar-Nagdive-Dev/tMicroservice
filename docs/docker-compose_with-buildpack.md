To create a Docker image using Buildpacks with Docker Compose for your Spring Boot application (`loanswithpostgresql`), follow these steps:
### 0. POM.xml
Make change in pom.xml add `<packaging>jar</packaging>` above `<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>` in pom.xml

### 1. Update `application.yml`
Make sure your `application.yml` is already configured correctly for PostgreSQL. Since you're using `localhost` in your `datasource` URL, you'll need to adjust this in the Docker environment because `localhost` inside a container refers to the container itself, not the host machine.

Update the `application.yml` to point to the PostgreSQL service in your Docker Compose network:
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/springdb
    username: tusharnagdive
    password: root
```

### 2. Create a `Dockerfile`
You don't need a `Dockerfile` since Buildpacks can automatically detect your application type and build an image. However, if you want to include one, create a minimal `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use a minimal base image provided by buildpacks
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

### 3. Define `docker-compose.yml`
Create or update your `docker-compose.yml` file to define both the Spring Boot application and PostgreSQL services.
```
version: '3.8'

services:
  loans-app:
    image: loanswithpostgresql-app
    ports:
      - "8003:8003"
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/springdb
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=tusharnagdive
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=root
    depends_on:
      - postgres

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: springdb
      POSTGRES_USER: tusharnagdive
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: root
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

### 4. Build the Docker Image
Run the following command to use Buildpacks to build your Spring Boot application Docker image:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build your Spring Boot application using Buildpacks.
- Start both the `loanswithpostgresql` Spring Boot app and the PostgreSQL database.

### 5. Verify the Application
Once everything is up, your Spring Boot application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8003` and connected to the PostgreSQL database.

### Notes
- Ensure PostgreSQL is working fine with the credentials and schema you defined.
- In a production environment, you might want to externalize credentials like PostgreSQL username and password using environment variables or Docker secrets.

The error you're encountering occurs because `docker-compose` does not recognize the `builder` property inside the `build` section. In `docker-compose.yml`, the `build` section doesn't support `builder` for specifying a buildpack builder image directly.

To resolve this issue, you can use a multi-step process: first, build the image using Buildpacks outside of Docker Compose, and then reference that image in your `docker-compose.yml`.

### Steps to Resolve:

#### 1. Build the Image with Buildpacks
Use the `pack` CLI tool to build the image using Buildpacks. Install the `pack` CLI if you donâ€™t have it yet:
```bash
brew install buildpacks/tap/pack
```

Then, build the image:
```bash
pack build loanswithpostgresql-app --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base
```

This command will create a Docker image named `loanswithpostgresql-app` using the Buildpacks builder.

#### 2. Update `docker-compose.yml`
Now, modify your `docker-compose.yml` to reference the built image instead of using the `build` section.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  loans-app:
    image: loanswithpostgresql-app
    ports:
      - "8003:8003"
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/springdb
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=tusharnagdive
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=root
    depends_on:
      - postgres

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: springdb
      POSTGRES_USER: tusharnagdive
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: root
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

#### 3. Run Docker Compose
After making the changes, you can run the containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start both the PostgreSQL and your Spring Boot application (`loanswithpostgresql-app`), and the two should communicate correctly.
